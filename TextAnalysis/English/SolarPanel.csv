"Hi, I am getting a CPO 2010 Prius III 38k miles with the Solar roof package. 
I have some concern with the solar roof on that particular car, the edge of each of those solar panel have some sort of discoloration, it looks like if you drip water on a ink jet printer printed paper. I'm afraid it's water that got into the sealed panel.
I really like that car and want to get it, I like the pearl white color which is strangely hard to find within 100 miles from where I live. But if the solar roof have problems, I am not going to get it. 
Those of you have a solar roof Prius, does those panels in the pictures look normal?
Do you have some similar discolorations?"
"I have the Solar Roof panels. I hope I don't misunderstand the feature, but it powers a fan that circulates outside air thru the cabin while parked in the sun. We have had a cold winter so I don't know how good this will work in the dead of summer."
"1. Solar Panel Ventilation System
This one uses the solar panel to power the fan to draw in outside air and vent the hot interior air. This is fully automatic (as long as you've enabled it before you turned off the car via a button to the left of the steering wheel). The fans will come on and off as needed and as power from the sun is stored (i.e. it will run intermittently if there isn't enough for a continuous run). The SPVS will continue to run even after you unlock the car and open the door. It will cancel once the car is started or turned to IG-ON.

2. Remote Air Conditioning
This is activated via the A/C button on the fob. This one starts up the A/C compressor to further cool the vehicle. The engine stays off because the compressor is powered by the hybrid battery. It will turn off after 3 mins, when the battery is low or when you open the door.


For me, I use the SPVS all the time during the summer. I actually forgot to use the Remote A/C (because i never touch the smart key!) but even in 30?¡ÆC weather, the solar panels kept the interior cool. Note that the solar panel is facing due south. If I parked the car facing south (so the panels are facing north), it might not be so cool inside so it works best in an open lot and you can position the car to face north (so that the solar panels face south). I might use the Remote A/C if I find myself not being able to park the car in such a position. My Prius isn't tinted nor do I use a sunshade (yet)."
"2010 Prius (Aug '09 delivery) w/ solar roof and 74,000km. No issues other than some rattling when it's open and I'm going over bumpy roads (it's only held at one end on rails because it goes over the roof, rather than in between the roof and the headliner). 

Just note that the wind deflector is a piece of glass so if the road has gravel or sand, I suggest not opening the roof in case the vehicle in front kicks up a rock and cracks the wind deflector (it has happened to a member here)."
Hail Storm Damage(Example)

" I bought a 2010 Prius 3 in 2010 and now have abut 63000 miles on it. I love this car. I have had no mechanical problems except one that made itself known just past the 36 month warranty period. 
I noticed that my solar driven cooling fan wasn't working this summer. I thought the fan had maybe died but then I looked at the solar panel and saw that green copper corrosion caused by long term moisture infiltration had shorted out the solar panel and it was unable to produce electricity anymore.

"solar panel failure caused by moisture infiltration I bought a 2010 Prius 3 in 2010 and now have abut 63000 miles on it. I love this car. I have had no mechanical problems except one that made itself known just past the 36 month warranty period. I noticed that my solar driven cooling fan wasn't working this summer. I thought the fan had maybe died but then I looked at the solar panel and saw that green copper corrosion caused by long term moisture infiltration had shorted out the solar panel and it was unable to produce electricity anymore.

I had the Dealer look at the panel and by looking at the panel from a ladder he ascertained that the moisture infiltration had reached all the way across the panel to the rear as evidenced by the green copper corrosion of the wiring in the panel. Now this just didn't happen overnight, but obviously, moisture had been infiltrating the panel for several years. There was no moisture visible in the pane, just the evidence of long term corrosion throughout the panel.

What I am saying is this. These panels were manufactured by an outside vendor for Toyota. If made properly, a solar panel should be hermetically sealed. Most solar panels normally have a useful life of 15 years. This panel was defective the day it was made and it just took 3 years for the corrosion to infiltrate deep enough to disable enough of the solar cells to render it inoperative. The reason I tell you this is the solar option is an expensive option.($2000 replacement cost) If you are still in your warranty period I would suggest having the panel inspected for corrosion before you experience a failure.

Once you know what to look for you can examine it yourself. Much like a hermetically sealed double pane house window there will be some clouding of the glass panel where the moisture has infiltrated. In my case the infiltration appears to have been going on for years before total failure. Since it is tinted and part of the roof design you won't notice the subtle changes in the color unless you inspect the panel closely.

In conclusion, these panels should be waterproof and sealed during manufacture. If any moisture infiltrates by means other than from damage it is a design and/or manufacturing error."
